ASSIGNMENT Abstract Contracts, Inheritance and Interfaces
ASSIGNMENT

In order to understand abstract contracts better copy the contracts below and test them out in Remix.

Animal, Cat and Dog contracts updated for Solidity ^0.5.0 (works also on ^0.4.24)

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
 
contract Animal {
 string public breed;
 uint public age;
 uint public weight;
 
 constructor() public {
 age = 1;
 weight = 1;
 }
 
 function sleep() pure public returns (string memory) {return Zzzzz...;}
 function eat() pure public returns (string memory) {return Nom nom..;}
 function talk() pure public returns (string memory);
}
 
contract Cat is Animal {
    constructor() public {
        breed = Persian;
        age = 3;
        weight = 5;
    }
    function talk() pure public returns (string memory) { return miaow;}
}
 
contract Dog is Animal {
    constructor() public {
        breed = Labrador;
        age = 5;
        weight = 3;
    }
    function talk() pure public returns (string memory) {return bark bark;}
}
Interface code updated for Solidity ^0.5.0

pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
 
interface Token {
    function transfer(address recipient, uint amount) external;
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
}
